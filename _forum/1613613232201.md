Welcome! I'm assuming you can read this, which means that this forum is now up-and-running! You can visit [this link](/forum/new) to design a new post in the website, or you can take a look at the Git repository [here](https://github.com/bassclefstudio/bassclefstudio.github.io)[^3] to write a post there and submit it via pull request. All forum posts are located in the `/_forum` directory, and those created in the website are pushed to the Git repository by [Staticman](https://staticman.net/).

Note that all forum posts must first pass moderation by myself or someone else with push access to the website's repository, so do be patient as posts won't show up right after you submit. Things such as tags and author bio pages can't yet be created in the website editor, but you or I can add them to the PR[^2] that's created by Staticman at any time.

# Markdown Syntax

All posts are written using Markdown syntax, details of which can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) and [here](https://commonmark.org/help/), but I'll give a brief demonstration here in this post.

## Headers:

```markdown
# This is a heading
This is some subtext

## This is a subheading
This is some more subtext
```
**Result:**
### This is a heading
This is some subtext

#### This is a subheading
This is some more subtext

## Paragraphs

```markdown
There's no break in between
these two lines of text.

But *this* is a paragraph break.

If you leave two spaces,  
or a backslash\
after a line, it becomes a single break.
```

**Result:**

There's no break in between
these two lines of text.

But *this* is a paragraph break.

If you leave two spaces,  
or a backslash\
after a line, it becomes a single break.

## Font Styles

```markdown
You can write text in **bold**, *italics*, or ***both!***.
```
**Result:**

You can write text in **bold**, *italics*, or ***both!***.

## Quotes

```markdown
> "This quote was taken out of context."
```
**Result:**

> "This quote was taken out of context."[^1]

## Links

```markdown
[Look at me, I'm a link!](#this-is-a-heading)

[This takes you to Google!](https://google.com)
```
**Result:**

[Look at me, I'm a link!](#this-is-a-heading)

[This takes you to Google!](https://google.com)

## Code

````markdown
If you ever need to write code, or write something in monospace, you can use `code blocks` or even:

```
A multi-line
code block!
```
````

**Result:**

If you ever need to write code, or write something in monospace, you can use `code blocks` or even:

```
A multi-line
code block!
```

# Conclusion

And... that's about all you need to know! There's a *lot* more Markdown syntax, but most of it is pretty self-explanatory (and in most cases unnecessary). You can check out those links [above](#markdown-syntax) if you want to learn more.

Hopefully you enjoy the forum! That's all for now!\
